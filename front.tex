% We claim that the ability in a personal agent, designed using \frameworkAinur, to  understand its human users' values helps the agent select ethical actions.

\begin{abstract}
A socially intelligent personal agent understands and helps its user navigate the norms governing the user's interaction in a society. This research seeks to advance the science of privacy by tackling nuanced notions of privacy in personal agents. It addresses the research question of how we can engineer social intelligence in a personal agent such that it selects ethically appropriate actions and delivers a pleasant and privacy-preserving social experience. Addressing this research question, we develop multiagent system techniques to engineer such socially intelligent and ethical personal agents.

This research develops (1) \frameworkA, a software engineering method to engineer privacy-aware personal agents by modeling social intelligence via norms, (2) \frameworkB, an approach that enables personal agents to reason about shared contexts and infer contextually relevant social norms that preserve privacy, and (3) \frameworkAinur, a decision-making framework to design personal agents that can reason about values and act ethically. 

\frameworkA goes beyond traditional software engineering methods to engineer personal agents by systematically capturing interactions that influence social experience. We claim that (1) \frameworkA supports developers in engineering intelligent personal agents, and (2) personal agents engineered using \frameworkA provide a better privacy-preserving social experience than agents engineered using a traditional software engineering method. We evaluate \frameworkA via a developer study and a set of simulation experiments and measure the social experience via metrics of norm compliance and sanction proportion.

A personal agent may deviate from norms in certain contexts. \frameworkB (1) enables personal agents deviating from norms to share deviation contexts with other agents in the agent society and (2) provides personal agents the ability to reason about shared contexts. We make two claims about the impact of context sharing and reasoning in \frameworkB. First, the ability to reason about deviation contexts helps a personal agent to accurately infer contextually relevant norms and to act in a privacy-respecting manner. Second, by acting according to such contextually relevant norms, a personal agent yields higher goal satisfaction to its users than an agent that does not reason about shared contexts. We demonstrate these claims via social simulations involving agent societies of varying sizes and diverse characteristics reflecting pragmatic, considerate, and selfish agents.

Privacy, values, and ethics are closely intertwined. Preserving privacy presumes  understanding human values and acting ethically. \frameworkAinur equips a personal agent with an understanding of values such as pleasure, privacy, recognition, and security, promoted or demoted by the agent's actions. This understanding of values helps personal agents to select ethically appropriate actions especially in scenarios where either the norms conflict or the value preferences of the users are not aligned.  We empirically evaluate \frameworkAinur via multiple simulation experiments. We find that agents developed using \frameworkAinur produce ethical actions that exhibit the Rawlsian property of fairness and yield a pleasant social experience to the agents' users.

\begin{biography}
% The author was born in a small town \ldots
Nirav Ajmeri was born to Vina and Suresh Ajmeri in Vadodara, the cultural capital of the state of Gujarat, India. He grew up in the sacred city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, India, and later lived in New Delhi, Vadodara, Thiruvananthapuram, and Pune in India. 

He obtained a B.E. in Computer Engineering from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Technology, Gujarat University, 
and an M.S. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University. 
Prior to joining North Carolina State University for his doctoral studies, Nirav worked as a researcher in Software Engineering Lab at Tata Research Design and Development Center, India. During his doctoral studies, Nirav interned at HERE Technologies (formerly Nokia Maps) with its CTO Research team as a research intern. 

Nirav loves his family, likes cricket and arcade games, and follows infrastructure forums. 
In his free time, he runs an arcade gaming website and a social bookmarking website.
